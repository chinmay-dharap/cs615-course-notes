Differnet types of data blocks sitting somewhere on a disk

A super block (if you miss a super block you look all the data on the super block)
-inode blocks
-data blocks
-directory blocks

inodes:
- inodes store metadata about the file but not the file name and file data. Too much file data but small metadata

Filesystems:

-ffs = fast file system


Important Notes:
================

Mount/Unmount:
--------------

A really interesting method to hide some files underneath a file system
just unmount the filesystem and create new files under the same file system name. After that to hide those new files we created just mount that file system which we just unmounted.


Union Mount:
------------

We can mount two filesystems together on top of another.
