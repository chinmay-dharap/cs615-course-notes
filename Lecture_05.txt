Lecture 05

Before Lecture:
==============

Before this lecture, as I took TCP/IP Networking course in last Fall, I know basics IP addressess and there types/classes. Also I have used tcpdump tool before when I learned about packet capture in my Certified Ethical Hacker course from EC Council. But RIR and LIR was two new concepts for me. I knew about IANA. But not about RIRs

After Lecture:
==============

IPv4 is 32 bits
    ex. 11111111 00000000 11110000 00001111

A IPv4 address is made up of 4 octets.

The netmask divides an IPv4 address into two parts:
    - Network component 
    - Host component
    
Without a router, hosts on the same domain can communicate with one another.

Class A, B, C, D, and E are the five classes of IPv4 networks.

Network address is for the subnet's initial address.
Broadcast address is the last address on the subnet.

IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, is in charge of managing the root zone and assigning global IP addresses and AS numbers.

Regional Internet Registries (RIR) is an organization that oversees the distribution and registration of Internet number resources in particular geographical areas.

RIRs give LIRs (Local Internet Registries) blocks of IP addresses.

ISPs, businesses with a large number of addresses, or educational institutions can be some examples of LIRs.

As more and more devices are added, the IPv4 address space is becoming increasingly scarce. IPv4 can only have 232 addresses because it is a 32-bit protocol.


There are 3 kinds of Address scopes:

    - Link-Local (example: fe80::e276:63ff:fe72:3900%xennet0)
        => Utilized on just one link
        => Links do not forward packets having link-local source or destination addresses.

    - Unique-Local (fc00::/7)
        => Utilized for personal IPv6 networks
        => Applications that are not globally routable and are similar to RFC 1918
        
    -  Global (for instance, 2001: 470: 1f07: 3d1:
        => An international address
        => Any area of the global network can receive packets with global addresses.
    
The RIRs receive Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from IANA.
        
Through the WHOIS protocol, one can search online databases for information such as IP blocks and ASNs. The internet is a real-world setting. Layer 2 protocol, or Data Link layer, is Ethernet.

To determine the route a packet follows, use Traceroute. Tcpdump is a tool which can be used to capture the network packets. Super-user privileges are necessary for tcpdump.
