Lecture 03

Before Lecture:
==============

Before this lecture as a primary linux user I was known to the Linux commands like "df", "mount". I also knew about the linux filesystem hierarchy.


After Lecture:
==============

System administrators frequently install new systems, develop new services, and must be able to tweak software right down to its most fundamental components.

All partitions can be mounted anywhere in the file-system hierarchy, with the exception of the root(/) partition.

The location of the disks/partitions to mount is specified in the file /etc/fstab.

We use the command "mount" to view the mounted file systems.


There are various file systems, including:

    - Regular
    - Journaling
    - Network

The file system is in charge of keeping data on the disk. As a result, it needs to be aware of the physical blocks where the data is stored.

Details kept in an inode:
    
    - User, Owner and Group owner IDâ€™s
    - File type
    - Access mode (permissions)
    - File access and modification time
    - Number of links to filesize of the file
    - Disk device containing this file
    
File types:
    - Regular files
    - Directories
    - Special files
    - Links
    - Sockets
    - Named pipes
    
    
Some systems, such as RAID controllers and Fibre Channel HBAs, are powered by proprietary firmware.

Every sysadmin has a preferred operating system as a result of their familiarity and years of experience. An HTTP server is one of the most popular services a system administrator may be responsible for.

The following steps could be included in the boot process:
    - POST (Power-On Self Test)
    - Primary boot loader execution
    - Execution of a secondary or second-stage boot loader with access to the MBR.
    - Initiating the privileged domain (dom0) and loading the hypervisor, etc.

The kernel can be characterized as the core element of the operating system that controls memory, devices, and processes while providing hardware access through a limited number of system calls. Many Unix versions are only available in one flavor, a single bundle of kernel, libraries, and system utilities - the open source BSD versions and all "old" commercial Unix versions fall into this group.

Shareable data files are those that are the same across several hosts and, as the manual page says, even even across various hardware architectures. Data files that need to be individual to each host are considered not shareable. Static files are those that are not anticipated to change while the system is running. The kernel, all system libraries, binaries, and other data files are included in this. Variable files are those that are changed at runtime by the OS, any active applications, or end users.

The hardware we choose, the CPU architecture, the amount of memory and disk space, and the variety of network ports are all determined by the machine's ultimate goal and the software it must run.

Later OS changes are expensive since services must be moved, ported, and verified while the server is already in operation. There is a fine line between system deployment and system configuration. There are valid reasons to manually install software on occasion.

Regardless of the technique we choose to install software using, we run the danger of unintentionally installing malware, a Trojan horse, or both on our machine.
